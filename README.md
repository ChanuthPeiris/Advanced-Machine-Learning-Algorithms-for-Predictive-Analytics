## Research Problem

The woodworking industry relies heavily on expert knowledge for assessing wood quality, which creates significant challenges for beginners and hobbyists. These individuals often struggle with identifying defects like knots, cracks, and branch inclusions, as well as distinguishing between wood types based on color, grain patterns, and texture. This lack of expertise leads to poor material selection, increased costs, and project failures. Current methods heavily depend on experienced carpenters, creating a barrier to entry for those without formal training. The absence of an accessible, reliable, and beginner-friendly solution for wood quality assessment underscores the need for technological intervention.


## Solution Overview 

The proposed solution is a machine learning-based system designed to analyze images of wood samples, providing real-time assessments of defects, wood types, and overall quality. By utilizing image processing and advanced algorithms, the model can extract key features such as texture, color, and patterns to deliver accurate insights and recommendations. This approach bridges the knowledge gap, empowering less experienced users to make informed decisions, reduce material wastage, and enhance the quality of their projects. This technology democratizes access to wood selection expertise, enabling efficient and reliable material evaluation for all.
